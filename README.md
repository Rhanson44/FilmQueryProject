# FilmQueryProject

## Project Overview

Create a command-line application that retrieves and displays film data. It will be menu-based, allowing the user to choose actions and submit query data.

The user is presented with a menu in which they can choose to:

1. Look up a film by its id.
2. Look up a film by a search keyword.
3. Exit the application.

If the film Id or keyword does not match an existing record, an appropriate message will be displayed.

When a film is displayed, its language is displayed, in addition to the film's title, year, rating, description, and list of actors.
